"""System for preserving backwards-compatibility for user data.

We store quite a lot of user data, and there's always only one right way to
write it to file. But when an update is released, we need to ensure that a new
version can read data stored by any previous version. Hence, this module stores
all prior loaders, binding them to their respective versions, so that we can
always read user data saved sometime in the past.

The mechanism relies on 3 classes:
* UserData defines the current representation of user data,
* DataManager provides a high-level interface for loading (any past format) and
  saving (current format) user data,
* Loaders stores all known loader functions together with version strings that
  indicate the earliest user data file version they are capable of reading.

The writing logic is simple: Main constructs the UserData object and puts there
all the user data serialized to strings, then calls DataManager to save that
object to a file. The save method writes a file in the current format.

Loading logic is a little more complicated, as it happens in two stages. First,
all the loaders for all previous versions of the program are prepared in an
OrderedDict. Second, Main requests the DataManager to load a given user data
file. DataManager reads the file and attempts to find a version string in its
data (on any failure it defaults to returning a default-constructed UserData
instance). When a version string is found, it finds the first loader capable of
reading it, and passes the file contents to that function, which constructs a
UserData instance and fills it with data. This function is responsible for
translation of the old data format (as seen in the file) to the current format
(as required by UserData and thus Main).

If a new version changes the UserData layout, *ALL* previous loaders have to be
updated to return this new layout. Therefore it is best not to modify the order
and names of UserData arguments.
